# shortest-path
Finds the shortest path and route of a graph.

### Usage
A makefile is included to easily compile the program. Navigate to the files and ensure they are all located in the same directory. Enter "make sp" to compile the program. Then enter "./sp" to run the program. The program will display the distance and route of the shortest path. 

loadG1() creates the a pre-made graph. Other graphs can be created and solved in the same fashion. Use the display("start", "end") function to input the starting and ending nodes.
